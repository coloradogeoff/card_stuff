  Use the text found on the postcard for the title.
  Potential buyers are interested in the full description or text from the front of the card.
  If the text is too long, please summarize.

  Return one field:
  1. Title (max 79 characters, sentence case, no pricing. However,
      add as much detail as possible up to the character limit)

  Examples:
  - Title: 1911 Denver, CO - Union Station - Divided Back
  - Title: Yosemite National Park - Color Linen Postcard - Unused

  More instructions for writing titles:
  - When crafting a title. Don't use location words more than once. For
    example, "Colorado Springs, Colorado" should be "Colorado Springs".
  - It is okay to remove articles like "the" or "a" from the title.
  - Try to avoid abbrevations for states, use full names (example: Minn should be Minnesota, Colo should be Colorado).
  - If the OCR text discovers a number (like a series number), if it is
    included, put it at the end of the location and description.
  - At the end of the title, include an indication of what era the card is from, 
    such as "Divided Back", "Undivided Back", or "Linen". This discription
    could also simply say "Antique", "1900s", "1910s", etc.
    IMPORTANT NOTE: Use the back of the card to determine if it is
    divided or undivided. If the back of the card has a line down the middle,
    it is divided. If there is no line, it is undivided.

  Use the text found on the card for the player name, card set, card number, and variety/parallel.
  Verify the player's name and card specifics using online resources if necessary.

  Return one field:
  1. Title (max 79 characters, sentence case, no pricing. However,
      add as much detail as possible up to the character limit)
  
  Follow these rules for the title:
     - Title (max 79 characters, sentence case, no pricing). I use a
       particular format for the title, so please follow it closely.
     - Format: [Player Name] - [Season Years] [Card Set] [Card Number] - [Variety/Parallel/Color]
       For [Player Name] use first than last name.
     - If the player is a rookie, include "(RC)" after the player's name.
     - Use all caps for the [player name] ie "LEBRON JAMES", "STEPH CURRY", etc.
     - The [Card Set] should be the season years, name of the card manufactur, such as "Topps", 
       "Panini", "Upper Deck", etc. Followed by the set name, such as "Chrome", "Prizm", 
       "Optic", "Obsidian", "Revolution", etc.
     - The season years should be formatted as "YYYY-YY", such as "2021-22", "2023-24", etc.
       This is most common for basketball and hockey cards. For football cards, the season year
       is usually just a single year, such as "2021", "2022", etc.
     - Usually, the season years, manufactur, and set name are found on the back of the card 
       near the bottom.
     - If the card is from a draft set, use the year of the draft, such as "2023 Draft Picks",
       also, this is most common for basketball.
     - There is no need to include the sport such as "basketball" or "football" in the title.
     - Some cards are considered "inserts". These are special cards that are inserted into packs
       at a lower rate than the base cards. If the card is an insert, put the [card number], after
       the insert name, such as "Galaxy #3".
       An example of an insert card title: PAOLO BANCHERO - 2024-25 Panini Select - Hot Stars #9
     - If the card is an insert, include "Insert" in the Variety/Parallel/Color section (if there is space).
     - If the card has a specific color add that in the Variety/Parallel/Color section.
       For example, "Green", "Red", "Blue", etc. The variety is determined by the color of the card. In 
       most cases, there are lists of varieties online with the set checklist.
  
  Example returns:
  Title: NIKOLA JOKIC - 2021-22 Panini Revolution #45 - Base
  Title: LEBRON JAMES - 2023-24 Topps Chrome #23 - Refractor
  Title: PAOLO BANCHERO - 2024-25 Panini Select - Hot Stars #9 Insert

  1. The player's name should be in all caps. This is IMPORTANT.
  2. The card set should include the season years, manufactur, and set name.
  3. The card number should be prefixed with a # symbol.
  4. The variety/parallel/color should be included if applicable.
  5. No need to include the team the player is on.
