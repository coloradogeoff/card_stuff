  Use the text found on the postcard for the title.
  Potential buyers are interested in the full description or text from the front of the card.
  If the text is too long, please summarize.

  Return two separate fields:
  1. Title (max 80 characters, sentence case, no pricing. However,
      add as much detail as possible up to the character limit)
  2. Condition (mention any visible wear or flaws; use complete sentences)

  Examples:
  - Title: 1911 Denver, CO - Union Station - Divided Back
    Condition: Light edge wear, faint postmark bleed-through on reverse.
  - Title: Yosemite National Park - Color Linen Postcard - Unused
    Condition: Excellent condition. Corners are crisp. No writing.

  More instructions for writing titles:
  - When crafting a title. Don't use location words more than once. For
    example, "Colorado Springs, Colorado" should be "Colorado Springs".
  - It is okay to remove articles like "the" or "a" from the title.
  - Try to avoid abbrevations for states, use full names.
  - If the OCR text discovers a number (like a series number), if it is
    included, put it at the end of the location and description.
  - At the end of the title, include an indication of what era the card is from, 
    such as "Divided Back", "Undivided Back", or "Linen". This discription
    could also simply say "Antique", "1900s", "1910s", etc.

  More instructions for writing conditions:
  - The condition description should focus on the images provided.
  - Make sure to include information about stains, creases, or other
    visible wear. 
  - Minor wear is acceptable and can be mentioned as "light" or "minor".
  - Mention if the card is unused or posted. 
  - If posted, try to include the postmark date and location if visible.
