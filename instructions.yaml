  Use the text found on the postcard for the title.
  Potential buyers are interested in the full description or text from the front of the card.
  If the text is too long, please summarize.

  Return one field:
  1. Title (max 80 characters, sentence case, no pricing. However,
      add as much detail as possible up to the character limit)

  Examples:
  - Title: 1911 Denver, CO - Union Station - Divided Back
  - Title: Yosemite National Park - Color Linen Postcard - Unused

  More instructions for writing titles:
  - When crafting a title. Don't use location words more than once. For
    example, "Colorado Springs, Colorado" should be "Colorado Springs".
  - It is okay to remove articles like "the" or "a" from the title.
  - Try to avoid abbrevations for states, use full names (example: Minn should be Minnesota, Colo should be Colorado).
  - If the OCR text discovers a number (like a series number), if it is
    included, put it at the end of the location and description.
  - At the end of the title, include an indication of what era the card is from, 
    such as "Divided Back", "Undivided Back", or "Linen". This discription
    could also simply say "Antique", "1900s", "1910s", etc.
    IMPORTANT NOTE: Use the back of the card to determine if it is
    divided or undivided. If the back of the card has a line down the middle,
    it is divided. If there is no line, it is undivided.
